## Principles of LLM as Backend
This project explores the implementation of Language Model (LLM) in GoLang programming. It aims to demonstrate the usage and integration of LLM within the GoLang environment.

Level up our use of LLMs. Learn to break down complex tasks, automate workflows, chain LLM calls, and get better outputs.

- Efficiently build multi-step systems using large language models.
- Learn to split complex tasks into a pipeline of subtasks using multistage prompts.
- Evaluate our LLM inputs and outputs for safety, accuracy, and relevance.
